### The Challenge:
- What are some factors in phone usage behavior?
- How can these insights help developers optimize app performance and reduce battery consumption?
- Why this matters?
   - Efficient mobile devices can reduce environmental impact.

### Data source:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset


### Outcome:
Our findings on the correlation of features within the dataset

- The heatmap reveals extremely strong correlations (0.93â€“0.96) between most of the variables, suggesting that App Usage Time, Battery Drain, Screen On Time, Number of Apps Installed, and Data Usage are all tightly connected in user behavior.
- The strongest correlation in the heatmap (0.96) between App Usage Time and Battery Drain suggests that app usage is one of the most influential factors on battery consumption. Users who spend more time on apps not only use more data but also experience significantly higher battery drain.
- The high correlation between Data Usage and Battery Drain (0.93) underscores the impact of data-heavy apps on battery life. Apps that require a lot of data, such as streaming services, social media, and video calls, can drain the battery quickly.
- This suggest that future developers may want to focus on optimizing battery usage, particularly by managing app activity and screen-on time. Overall reducing the data footprint of their apps. 

Through our analysis we have found that generally per age group device behavior is about the same. Two of the four age groups did have lower amounts of all the features, while youngest and oldest age groups had the highest.

While there are slight differences we can see that it will either be the same as the age groups increase in numbers as modern tech ages with us or increase in numbers as technology becomes even more accessible through the years.

Currently there is correlation of Battery Drain through "Screen-on-time" than anything else, while previous assumption was the phones App Usage; it seems that people either accidentally or through force of habit leave the phone screen on while unattended or while not in use.
  - It is important to make sure we have less battery drain on our mobile devices as it is our direct form of contact for personal or family emergencies of any kind.
